## Abstract

This is the report for the **second project** of the Security in Software Applications course directed by Daniele Friolo for the Academic Year 24/25 for the Master's Degree in **Cybersecurity** at Sapienza University of Rome. In this homework, the goal was to use the [flawfinder](https://dwheeler.com/flawfinder/) tool to **statically analyze** the provided code fragment, **reason** on all of the tool's reports, and finally output a **corrected** version where all found vulnerabilities are removed.

## Flawfinder
The flawfinder tool is a **simple, fast and lightweight** command-line utility tool for scanning C/C+ code for known security vulnerabilities. It is great as a **first check** for quickly identifying possible security problems within the code before it is sent to **more thorough** analysis tools.

Its biggest **weaknesses** lie in the fact that it is limited to static analysis only, has a high **false positive** rate, has no context awareness, and that it cannot be relied upon on its own. 

## Making the code compilable
The provided C code is **not compilable** due to multiple syntax errors, part of which are shown below

![](images/noncompilable.png)

In order to have a **more representative** output from the tool, it was decided to make the code compilable by fixing the errors in the **most faithful way** possible. The philosophy behind this idea is that even if every vulnerability was fixed in the noncompilable version, someone would **eventually need** to make the code compilable, which could lead to new vulnerabilities.

Most importantly, the code was converted into C++ to preserve the `trycatch` construct, as it does not exist in plain C. This is **not an issue** as the tool is able to analyze .cpp files either way. 

## Utilizing the tool
The tool was then ran on the **compilable version** of the code to look for potential vulnerabilities

The following is a **rundown** of all the 13 detected warnings ordered by their **[risk levels]**

#### `1. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:40  [4] (buffer) strcpy`

```
Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy
```
(**True Positive**) This alert is shown because the variable `foo` is copied into `buffer` with `strcpy()` without boundary checking the source's length. This can easily lead to heap buffer overflow and is extremely dangerous to leave as is.

#### `2. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:56  [4] (format) fprintf`

```
If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be 
exploited (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
```
(**True Positive**) This alert raises the issue that the message thrown to handle the `isalpha()` failed check in `func3()` can be exploited by an attacker to perform format string due to missing format specifiers in `fprintf()` in the `catch` code block.

#### `3. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:8  [2] (buffer) char`

```
Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to
potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).
```
(**True Positive**) This alert is concerning but not for the reason specified, as `dst` initialization is properly sized, but for the fact that if the attacker could input an arbitrarily long `src` then they could cause the stack to blow, causing a denial of service.

#### `4. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:27  [2] (buffer) char`

```
Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to 
potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). 
```
(**False Positive**) This alert isn't concerning, because `fgets()` correctly prevents the user from inputting more than 1024 characters inside `buffer`. The only problem may be that `\n` is not removed upon copying, which isn't a security issue.


#### `5. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:32  [2] (buffer) char`

```
Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to 
potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). 
```
(**False Positive**) This alert also isn't concerning, because `strncpy()` correctly prevents the user from inputting more than 1024 characters inside `errormsg`. 

#### `6. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:34  [2] (buffer) strcat`

```
Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
[MS-banned] (CWE-120). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
```
(**False Positive**) This alert also isn't concerning because `strcat()` is concatenating a constant string on the destination buffer `errormsg` and there is exactly enough space for it (20 bytes). It is, however, bad practice manually counting the bytes in the string.

#### `7. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:8  [1] (buffer) strlen`


```
Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
perform an over-read (could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
```
(**True Positive**) This alert shows that the code assumes that `src` is null-terminated, if so then `strlen()` works as expected, otherwise an attacker that has access to `src` may be able to copy strings that are longer than the code is expecting, leading to undefined behaviour.

#### `8. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:9  [1] (buffer) strncpy`

```
Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for 
invalid pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120).
```
(**True Positive**) This alert is a concern because `strncpy()` assumes that `src` is a null-terminated string, if so then the terminator `\0` is successfully copied, otherwise it is not, also leading the following null-termination to fail.

#### `9. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:9  [1] (buffer) strlen`

```
Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
perform an over-read (could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
```
(**True Positive**) This alert is a problem due to the fact that as already explained in **`7.`** the code is assuming `src` to be null-terminated, if this isn't the case then `strncpy()` will keep reading bytes from memory until it finds a terminator `\0` or terminates the bytes it has to read.

#### `10. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:10  [1] (buffer) strlen`

```
Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
perform an over-read (could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
```
(**True Positive**) This alert is also a concern because as already explained in **`7.`** and **`9.`** the code is assuming `src` to be null-terminated, if this isn't the case then the terminator `\0` would be appended later than expected and causing undefined behaviour, including crashes.

#### `11. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:16  [1] (buffer) read`

```
Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops
(CWE-120, CWE-20).
```
(**False Positive**) This alert does not raise such concern because the buffer in question (`len`) is not used within a loop.

#### `12. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:22  [1] (buffer) read`

```
Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).
```
(**False Positive**) This alert does not raise such concern because the buffer in question (`buf`) is not used within a loop.

#### `13. project1_SSA24_compilable.cpp:33  [1] (buffer) strncpy`


```
Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for invalid
pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120).
```
(**False Positive**) This alert is very similar to **`6.`** but despite `strncpy()` not copying the terminator `\0` from `buffer`, in this specific case `strcat()` concatenates a constant string next to it which has it. If this wasn't the case, then it would have been an issue.

\newpage

## Undetected vulnerabilities
Flawfinder has its own *flaws* (pun intended) with unfortunately its own fair share of **false negatives**. The following is a list of **everything** it has missed.

```cpp
// No checks on the return value of read()
void func2(int fd) {
    char* buf;
    size_t len;
    read(fd, &len, sizeof(len));

    if (len > 1024)
        return;
    ...     
    read(fd, buf, len); 
}
```
The `read()` function could return **partial data or fail**, and no check is performed to ensure its correctness. In the case of failure, data in `len` and/or `buf` may be **garbage or malformed values**.

```cpp
// Potential null pointer dereferecing on buf
buf = (char*)malloc(len+1);
buf[len] = '\0';
```
Due to missing checks on `malloc()` return value, in case of failure the last line will try to dereference a `null` pointer, causing the problem to **crash**.

```cpp
// Potential null pointer dereferecing on src
void func1(char* src) {
    char dst[(strlen(src) + 1) * sizeof(char)];
    ...
}
```
This function assumes that `src` is a non-null string, if this is not the case then the following line will try to dereference a `null` pointer, causing the program to **crash**.

```cpp
// Potential invalid read() call
void func2(int fd) {
    char* buf;
    size_t len;
    read(fd, &len, sizeof(len));
    ...
}
```
The function assumes that `fd` is a **positive integer**, if this isn't the case then `read()` would fail and, being not handled by the program, would result in undefined behaviour.

```cpp
// Out-of-bounds on first iteration 
int main() {
    int y=10;
    int a[10];
    ...
    while (y>=0) {  
        a[y]=y;     
        y=y-1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this snippet the `while` loop starts iterating on `a` starting from `a[10]`, which is **outside the array** itself, causing an out-of-bound write on the **very first** iteration.

```cpp
// No checks on the return value of fgets()
void func3() {	
    char buffer[1024];
    printf("Please enter your user id :");
    fgets(buffer, 1024, stdin);
    ...
}
```
The `fgets()` function in above code could return an **error** of an **EoF**, no check is performed to ensure its correctness. In the case of failure, data in `buffer` may be **garbage or malformed values**.

```cpp
// Potential null pointer dereferecing on buffer
void func4(char *foo) {
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(10 * sizeof(char));
    strcpy(buffer, foo);    
}
```
Due to missing checks on `malloc()` return value, in case of failure the last line will try to dereference a `null` pointer, causing the problem to **crash**.

```cpp
// Potential null pointer dereferecing on foo
void func4(char *foo) {
    ...
    strcpy(buffer, foo);    
}
```
This function assumes that `foo` is a non-null string, if this is not the case then the last line will try to dereference a `null` pointer, causing the program to **crash**.

## Corrected version 
The following snippet contains the corrected version of the code with **comments** attached 
```cpp 
#include <stdlib.h> // added 
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>  // added 
#include <unistd.h> // added 

void func1(char *src) {
    // added null check
    if(!src) {
        return;
    }

    // added maximum length for security 
    const size_t MAX_SIZE = 1024;       
    // function assumes src is null terminated
    size_t len = strlen(src);           // Flawfinder: ignore

    // check on maximum length 
    if(len > MAX_SIZE) {
        len = MAX_SIZE;
        src[MAX_SIZE-1] = '\0';
    }

    // added +1 for more clarity and removed char
    char dst[len+1];                    // Flawfinder: ignore
    // removed "+ sizeof(char)"
    strncpy(dst, src, len);             // Flawfinder: ignore
    dst[len] = '\0';                    // instead of strlen(dst)
}

// changed "int fd" into "size_t fd"
void func2(size_t fd) { 
    // added maximum length for security
    const size_t MAX_SIZE = 1024;       
    char* buf;
    size_t len;

    // checking partial read
    size_t n = read(fd, &len, sizeof(len));     // Flawfinder: ignore
    if (n != sizeof(len)) {
        return;
    }
    if (len > MAX_SIZE) {
        return;
    }

    buf = (char *)malloc(len+1);     // (char *) to make it compilable
    // checking malloc failure 
    if(!buf) {
        return;
    }

    // checking partial read
    n = read(fd, buf, len);         // Flawfinder: ignore
    if (n != len) {
        free(buf);
        return;
    }
    buf[len] = '\0';
    free(buf);
}

void func3() {	
    // added size variable to make couting easier and more reliable
    const size_t BUF_SIZE = 1024;
    char buffer[BUF_SIZE];                          // Flawfinder: ignore
    
    printf("Please enter your user id :");
    if(!fgets(buffer, BUF_SIZE, stdin)) {
        // in case of error
        exit(1);
    }
    // buffer is already string terminated 
    // here we substitute \n with string terminator instead
    buffer[strlen(buffer)-1] = '\0';                // Flawfinder: ignore

    if (!isalpha(buffer[0])) {   
        // added to be sure of not failing the count 
        const char* is_not_valid_ID = " is not  a valid ID"; 

        // changed into malloc() to allow for variable length array
        // is to avoid counting strlen(is_not_valid_ID) manually
        // not actually a vulnerability, it is to avoid a bad practice 
        char *errormsg = (char *)malloc(BUF_SIZE + strlen(is_not_valid_ID) + 1);    // Flawfinder: ignore 
        if(!errormsg) {
            exit(1);
        }

        // may not copy string terminator, added for good practice
        strncpy(errormsg, buffer, BUF_SIZE-1);      // Flawfinder: ignore
        errormsg[BUF_SIZE-1] = '\0';
        // this is ok: is_not_valid_ID has '\0' and strcat attaches it
        strcat(errormsg, is_not_valid_ID);          // Flawfinder: ignore
        // added otherwise function doesnt make sense
        throw errormsg;                             
        free(errormsg);
    }
}

void func4(char *foo) {
    // added null check
    if(!foo) {
        return;
    }

    // added size variable to make couting easier and more reliable
    const size_t BUF_SIZE = 10;
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(BUF_SIZE * sizeof(char));
    // checking malloc failure 
    if(!buffer) {
        return;
    }

    // copies at most 10 bytes
    strncpy(buffer, foo, BUF_SIZE-1);   // Flawfinder: ignore
    buffer[BUF_SIZE-1] = '\0';          // added string terminator

    free(buffer);
}

int main() {
    int i=10;       // renamed into i for better understanding
    int a[10];

    // does not cause malloc to crash anymore
    func4("fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo");

    try { 
        func3();
    }
    catch(char* message) {	
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", message);       // added "%s"  
    }
    
    // aFile not declared
    //fprintf(aFile, "%s", "hello world");
 
    // added predecrement
    while (--i>=0) {  
        a[i]=i;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

By also removing abovementioned false positives, the corrected code results in the tool making **no more complains**, as shown in the following screenshot

![](images/flawfinder_no_complains.png)

In conclusion, Flawfinder's purpose is it **find vulnerabilities** so that they can be fixed. However, it shall be said that developers must know how to develop secure software **to begin** with before utilizing it, as *a fool with a tool is still a fool!*
